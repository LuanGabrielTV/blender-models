# blender-models

This repository will be constantly updated with 3d models free to download and use. If you want to credit me, thanks! If not, that's okay. The idea of making everything out of procedural textures was my approach to allow anyone to make use these assets without having to credit anyone, and knowing that 3D is a nice tool, but, at first glance, may seem a little complicated, the whole purpose of this project was to make things easier for beginner creators. In that sense, some of the files will already have a default animation, so that everything is ready for exporting, if that's what you're looking for.

Anyway, if, before downloading, you want to have a better look at the models, you can go to my Artstation page, where everything will be posted: https://www.artstation.com/luangtv. Thanks!
